<h1> Javascript for WIX pages</h1>

    A template for adding javascript code, animations or else to your WIX page.
    took me some time to figure it out, so i think its useful for others.

<h2> Installation</h2>

  01. add your script between the script tags in the html file.
  02. on your WIX page open : ADD , More , Embed a Side
  03. On your widget go to "Enter Webside adress", change
      to "Code" and paste your code.
